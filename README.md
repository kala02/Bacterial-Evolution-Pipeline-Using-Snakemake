# Bacterial-Evolution-Pipeline-Using-Snakemake
Automated workflow for analysing bacterial evolution using Snakemake. Integrates bioinformatics tools for sequence download, alignment, variant calling and genome annotation. This pipeline is developed to compare ancestral and evolved bacterial strains to identify genetic variations responsible for adaptation.
